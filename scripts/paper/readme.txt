scripts to reproduce the experiment results in the paper.

We have generated sequences and patterns.
patterns are generated by generate_pattern_groups()

steps: 
1. put everthing in folder  '../storage/vsim-all/', 
  the folder should have two subfolders: 
    'raw' (to place raw sequences)
    'pattern-builder2' (to place the pattern groups)
2. run 'scripts/build_indexes.py' to build indexes for all videos with different discretization functions.
3. *Figure Generation*.
